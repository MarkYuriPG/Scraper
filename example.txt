- "Network": Two or more connected computers that can share resources such as data, a printer, an Internet connection, applications, or a combination of 
these resources.
- Types of Networks:
  - Local Area Network (LAN)
  - Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
  - Wide Area Network (WAN)
- WAN Technologies: Circuit-switched, Asynchronous serial, ISDN Layer 1, Leased Line, Synchronous serial, Broadband Access, Cable, DSL, Wireless WAN, Frame-Relay.
- Network Topologies: Bus Topology, Star Topology, Extended Star Topology.
- OSI Model: A layered network model that reduces complexity, standardizes interfaces, facilitates modular engineering, ensures interoperable technology, accelerates evolution, and simplifies teaching and learning.
- Seven Layers of the OSI Model: 
  - Application Layers (Upper Layers): Network Processes to Applications, Data Representation, InterHost Communication.
  - End To End Connections: Handles transportation issues between hosts, ensures data transport reliability, establishes, maintains and terminates virtual circuits, provides reliability through fault detection and recovery, information flow control.
  - Data Delivery: Provides connectivity and path selection between two host systems, routes data packets, selects best path to deliver data, prioritizes data known as Quality of Service (QoS).
  - Access to Media: Defines how data is formatted for transmission and how access to the network is controlled.
  - Binary Transmission: Defines the electrical, mechanical, procedural, and functional specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the 
physical link.
- Physical Media Types: Twisted Pair, Coaxial, Fiber Optic, Wireless LAN.
- Devices: Hub or Repeater, Network Interface Card, Data Link Devices (Bridges and Switches), Network Layer Devices (Routers and Layer 3 Switches).      
- IP Address: A standard that defines the manner in which the network layers of two hosts interact. IP addresses are 32 bit long, hierarchical addressing scheme.
- Gateway: A combination of hardware and software that connects dissimilar network environments. It performs translations at multiple layers of the open 
system interconnection (OSI) model.
- Firewall: A system or group of systems that manages access between two or more networks.
